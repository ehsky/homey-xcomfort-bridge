# Copilot Instructions: Homey xComfort Bridge App

## Goals
- Integrate xComfort Bridge devices with Homey Pro
- Support multiple drivers: bridge, dimming actuator, room
- Ensure device persistence in Homey Flows
- Use Homey Apps SDK v3 best practices

## Architecture
- `/drivers/xcomfort-bridge/`: Bridge driver
- `/drivers/xcomfort-dimming-actuator/`: Dimming actuator driver
- `/drivers/xcomfort-room/`: Room driver
- `/lib/XComfortConnection.js`: Shared bridge connection logic
- `app.js`: Main app coordinator

## Implementation Notes
- Device capabilities: `onoff`, `dim`
- Device classes: `light`, `other`
- Devices remain available in Flows even if bridge is offline
- Follow SDK v3 for pairing, device management, Flow cards

## Next Steps
1. Scaffold Homey app structure
2. Implement shared connection library
3. Implement drivers for bridge, dimming actuator, room
4. Add pairing and device management logic
5. Test device persistence and Flow integration
