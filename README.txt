Connect your Eaton xComfort Bridge to Homey for complete smart home lighting control. This app automatically discovers all connected dimming actuators and room controllers, bringing them into your Homey ecosystem with real-time status updates.

Control individual lights with precise dimming, monitor room temperatures from compatible actuators, and manage entire rooms with presence detection and environmental monitoring. Requires your xComfort Bridge IP address and authentication key for setup.
